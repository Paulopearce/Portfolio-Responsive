Portfolio responsive webpage 

A website presenting my programming projects, showcasing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap framework.

Site includes three pages: The home page(index.html), which contains a slideshow made with a component template from the Bootstrap framework. This slideshow exhibits all of my projects made in my Web Development Coding Boot Camp at UCI Division of Continuing Education thus far. The slideshow automatically cycles through the images of my web development portfolio, each containing titles and descriptions of the projects. It utilizes buttons on the left and right side to cycle forward or backwards through the slides and buttons on the bottom used to select the exact photo you would like to view. The contact page (contact.html), contains a contact card made with a component template from the Bootstrap framework. Third and finally, the portfolio page(portfolio.html) which contains cards that display the different individual projects I have developed as a student at  the Web Development Coding Boot Camp at UCI Division of Continuing Education.

Each page was made with the bootstrap framework and includes a responsive navigation bar that is fixed to the top of the page. This nav bar menu consolidates on a smaller screens allowing you to navigate the pages with a drop-down menu. This menu is accessed by with a press of a single navigation menu drop-down button in the navigation bar. This allows simple navigation between the aforementioned three HTML pages. Each page is responsive, made possible with Bootstrap. The pages contains space on the left and right sides of the content until viewed on a small screen or window, which will allow you to view the content in columns spanning the entire width of the screen, in an order specified by Bootstrap classes.
